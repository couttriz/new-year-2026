# 🎆 2026 Year of the Fire Horse - Interactive Fireworks

An interactive web-based e-greeting card celebrating the 2026 Lunar New Year (Year of the Fire Horse) with realistic, physics-based fireworks. This project is built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript (Canvas API)**, without the use of any third-party libraries.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Realistic Physics Engine:** Simulates gravity, air resistance, smoke trails, and glow blending modes to create highly realistic sparks and explosions.
* **Custom Firework Shapes:** Uses an intelligent pixel-scanning algorithm to generate fireworks in iconic Lunar New Year shapes:
  * ♞ Fire-Gradient Horse Head (Symbol of the 2026 Binh Ngo year)
  * 🌸 Vibrant Peach Blossom branch
  * 🟩 Traditional green Banh Chung (Square sticky rice cake)
  * ♥ Red Heart
* **Starry Night & Deep Space Context:** A background canvas featuring a twinkling star algorithm, combined with a ground silhouette and a scrolling text marquee with New Year wishes.
* **"No-Fly Zone" Algorithm (Smart Avoidance):** Fireworks are programmed to automatically divert their paths, ensuring they don't explode over and obscure the main greeting message in the center of the screen.
* **Lag-Free Interaction:** Supports mouse clicks (Desktop) and touch events (Mobile) to manually launch fireworks. The interaction has been optimized to prevent lag even with rapid, continuous clicking/tapping.
* **100% Responsive:** The layout automatically adjusts and fits perfectly across all device sizes (PC, Tablet, Mobile).
